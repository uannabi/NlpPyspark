# NlpPyspark

Welcome to the PySpark NLP repository! This project is dedicated to exploring how PySpark has made Natural Language Processing (NLP) easier and more accessible than ever before. 

## About This Repository
Natural Language Processing is a crucial aspect of data science, involving the interaction between computers and human language. PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark, offers powerful, scalable, and easy-to-use tools that significantly simplify the process of implementing NLP tasks. This repository aims to demonstrate these capabilities through practical examples and clear explanations.

## What You'll Find Here
- **NLP Basics with PySpark:** An introduction to NLP concepts using PySpark.
- **Text Processing:** Techniques for text cleaning, tokenization, and preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating NLP features like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and n-grams.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Building models to analyze sentiments in text data.
- **Scalable NLP Pipelines:** Constructing end-to-end NLP pipelines that can handle large datasets efficiently.
